Sitting Room
This is the room where you sit a lot. Well, you sleep here sometimes too. But there is a different room that is just for sleeping, and it is to the north. There's another room to the west. It's the room with the food. That is a good room.

Even though this is the sitting room you can't sit on everything. There are a lot of ""no""s here, like the thing you can't scratch, and the tall thing and the four-legged thing that isn't alive but that stands still with the box of light on its back.

Your pet is here, all stretched out on the long soft thing and snoring. ",w,0,"

With one giant leap, you rise to meet the snack of your dreams, snatching it out of the air and wolfing it down in one great gulp. Yum! It was an awesome sandwich!

As your pet falls, he manages to land on the square soft thing. Picking himself up, he shakes his head at you. ""Wow, Hardy,"" he laughs, ""you must have wanted that sandwich bad. Guess I'll be making another one for me.""

You're sure glad your pet has a sense of humor. You lick your chops happily. And wonder what's for dinner...

The thief gestures mysteriously, and the treasures in the room suddenly vanish.

Treasure Room
This is a large room, whose east wall is solid granite. A number of discarded bags, which crumble at your touch, are scattered about on the floor. There is an exit down a staircase.
There is a suspicious-looking individual, holding a large bag, leaning against one wall. He is armed with a deadly stiletto.
There is a silver chalice, intricately engraved, here.
The thief stabs nonchalantly with his stiletto and misses.
