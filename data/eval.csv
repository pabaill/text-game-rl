Man, what a party! That was a night to remember - actually it'll be a miracle if I remember it at all tomorrow!  Oh, by the way, I'm Goldilocks. I'm a nineteen year old blonde bombshell and I'm on my way back from yet another crazy art school party. It's about five AM and the sun's already up, as are the birds, who are doing their level best to aggravate my hangover with their bloody singing! I could really use something to eat and somewhere to sleep off this hangover, but something tells me I shouldn't have taken this shortcut through the forest. I have a really baaad feeling about it...
Goldilocks is a FOX!

In the enchanted forest
A large wooden sign informs me that I'm in the Enchanted Forest. What it doesn't tell me is how the hell I get out! Everywhere I look there are trees, trees, trees. This place definately has a 'tree' theme going. A clearly marked path leads south and west, whilst in every other direction are, well, trees.

On a path in the forest
I'm on a path winding through the Enchanted Forest. The path winds its way from the north towards the west. In every other direction there are dark, sinister looking trees that wave their branches at me in an anthropomorphic kind of way. Ooh, I'm soooo scared!",False,eval/training_data_gold.z5_p_rand_0.5.csv

Lost in the forest
I'm walking in a trackless wilderness of tall, straight trees whose mighty trunks remind me of the time I got lost among the Axminsters at CarpetWorld aged six. I can go in just about any direction, but they all look the same to me. ",False,eval/training_data_gold.z5_p_rand_0.5.csv
"As I head off along the path a pathetic, mangey looking wolf jumps out from behind a bush and slobbers at me in what he probably hopes is a menacing way.
   'I am the Big Bad Wolf!' says he. Then, after an awkward pause he adds 'well, what are you waiting for? Aren't you going to ask me the way to Grandma's house?' He looks at me quizzically for a moment and then slaps his forehead.
   'My humblest apologies!' he says. 'You are not the young woman I seek. She of the crimson shawl must needs be elsewhere!' He darts back into the forest.


At a fork in the path
I'm at a fork in the path. Not the kind of fork you eat with, the sort where the path forks; you know, like a fork. To the north the path widens into a clearing. To the west it disappears into the forest.",north,0,"
In a clearing in the forest
I'm in a clearing. There is a teeny tiny cottage here complete with a thatched roof and leaded windows.

A little path lined by rows of white-painted stones leads around the side of the house to the west.",False,eval/training_data_gold.z5_p_rand_0.5.csv

"You flip through the book and come to the section on the fabled dragons of the sixth layer. It states that there are three fearsome dragons in this part of the underworld that must be challenged before the Jewel can be obtained.

The first is the White Dragon, which lives in a cold and icy lair. His deadliest weapon is a cone of frost that can freeze an entire army dead in their tracks. He is the oldest and wisest of the dragons.

The Black Dragon is another fearsome opponent. His breath weapon is a stream of acid that can corrode the toughest of metals, not to mention bone and skin. The oracles have sensed that he is a rather lazy dragon and is content to count his baubles rather than concern himself with otherworldly affairs.

The final dragon, and fabled keeper of the Jewel, is the fearsome Red Dragon. She is the strongest of the dragons and breathes an indefensible blast of fire which will incinerate anything it touches. The Red Dragon is merciless. She will always prefer to attack first and ask questions later (if there's anyone left to answer).

Although these dragons have never been viewed, the oracles are reasonably sure of these facts because of years of meditation and mystical incantations.

Be cautious, however, the coat can only absorb one time (it would take an incredible amount of power to rip the original item from the coat's fibers), and once an item has been absorbed, it's lost forever.

Terminal Room
This is a large room crammed with computer terminals, small computers, and printers. An exit leads south. Banners, posters, and signs festoon the walls. Most of the tables are covered with waste paper, old pizza boxes, and empty Coke cans. There are usually a lot of people here, but tonight it's almost deserted.

A really whiz-bang pc is right inside the door.

Nearby is one of those ugly molded plastic chairs.

Sitting at a terminal is a hacker whom you recognize.

The computer powers up, goes through a remarkably fast self-check, and greets you, requesting ""LOGIN PLEASE:"". The only sound you hear is a very low hum.

The computer responds ""Good evening. You're here awfully late."" It displays a list of pending tasks, one of which is in blinking red letters, with large arrows pointing to it. The task reads ""Classics Paper,"" some particularly ominous words next to it say ""DUE TOMORROW!"" and more reassuringly, a menu box next to that reads ""Edit Classics Paper.""

""There, that's done. Don't move from there, it'll only make things worse for you."" He makes some odd gestures at the archway and then goes over to the lab bench.

Terminal Room
This is a large room crammed with computer terminals, small computers, and printers. An exit leads south. Banners, posters, and signs festoon the walls. Most of the tables are covered with waste paper, old pizza boxes, and empty Coke cans. There are usually a lot of people here, but tonight it's almost deserted.

A really whiz-bang pc is right inside the door.

Nearby is one of those ugly molded plastic chairs.

Sitting at a terminal is a hacker whom you recognize.

This isn't happening, it really isn't.  You were just about to finish up a two week probationary period as a site operator at the University computer center on the third floor of Hodges Hall.  It was a quiet night, you were working on that interactive fiction game, nobody around...and then you saw a shadow out of the corner of your eye.  And one of the laser printers is gone.  Unless it's back before 7am, this job - the one you were counting on to pay your tuition next semester - is, shall we say, history.  You sigh.  It's not going to be just another...

Gnome's Lair
You are in a small room, lit only by a bare 40-watt light bulb hanging from the ceiling.  The floor is littered with paper listings and several copies of ""Spelunker Today.""  On a table you see a very disreputable-looking IBM PC clone... and the missing Owlet-Picker V printer!

In a corner, there's a boombox playing the Toccata and Fugue in D Minor, by J.S. Bach.

A geeky-looking gnome sits staring into the computer, muttering dire curses at his modem, the phone company, the author of the language he's writing a game in, the computer, the printer, and anything else he can think of.

This isn't happening, it really isn't.  You were just about to finish up a two week probationary period as a site operator at the University computer center on the third floor of Hodges Hall.  It was a quiet night, you were working on that interactive fiction game, nobody around...and then you saw a shadow out of the corner of your eye.  And one of the laser printers is gone.  Unless it's back before 7am, this job - the one you were counting on to pay your tuition next semester - is, shall we say, history.  You sigh.  It's not going to be just another...

Computer Site

This is the computer site.  You know, half a dozen PCs, couple of Macs, a printer table, the desk at which you write that interactive fiction game instead of study.  An internet router hums quietly in the corner.

The door is northeast.

You are in a small room, lit only by a bare 40-watt light bulb hanging from the ceiling.  The floor is littered with paper listings and several copies of ""Spelunker Today.""  On a table you see a very disreputable-looking IBM PC clone... and the missing Owlet-Picker V printer!

In a corner, there's a boombox playing the Toccata and Fugue in D Minor, by J.S. Bach.

This isn't happening, it really isn't.  You were just about to finish up a two week probationary period as a site operator at the University computer center on the third floor of Hodges Hall.  It was a quiet night, you were working on that interactive fiction game, nobody around...and then you saw a shadow out of the corner of your eye.  And one of the laser printers is gone.  Unless it's back before 7am, this job - the one you were counting on to pay your tuition next semester - is, shall we say, history.  You sigh.  It's not going to be just another...

Printing...

The remaining laser printer fires up and starts printing.  It seems to take forever, but eventually a copy of ""The Inform Designer's Manual"" sits on the table beside the printer.

This isn't happening, it really isn't.  You were just about to finish up a two week probationary period as a site operator at the University computer center on the third floor of Hodges Hall.  It was a quiet night, you were working on that interactive fiction game, nobody around...and then you saw a shadow out of the corner of your eye.  And one of the laser printers is gone.  Unless it's back before 7am, this job - the one you were counting on to pay your tuition next semester - is, shall we say, history.  You sigh.  It's not going to be just another...

This isn't happening, it really isn't.  You were just about to finish up a two week probationary period as a site operator at the University computer center on the third floor of Hodges Hall.  It was a quiet night, you were working on that interactive fiction game, nobody around...and then you saw a shadow out of the corner of your eye.  And one of the laser printers is gone.  Unless it's back before 7am, this job - the one you were counting on to pay your tuition next semester - is, shall we say, history.  You sigh.  It's not going to be just another...

NIGHT AT THE COMPUTER CENTER
An Interactive Nocturnal Chase

Computer Site

This is the computer site.  You know, half a dozen PCs, couple of Macs, a printer table, the desk at which you write that interactive fiction game instead of study.  An internet router hums quietly in the corner.

The door is northeast.
