Court Yard
A good sized courtyard with an air of late British colonialism about it.  To the west, in the direction the sun is setting, is a high, grey stone wall with an ornate iron gate set into the rock.  The walls of a large stone mansion rise several stories into the chilly evening air to the east, north, and south.  In the east wall, two or three stories up, is a large window.  On top of the west wall, above and to the right of the gate, is a large squirrels nest made of sticks, twigs, and leaves.

A carpeting of old brown leaves from past winters rustle about on the ground in the breeze and drift listlessly across a cracked, stained, pale green tennis court with a rotting net.  In one corner of the court yard an impressively large oak tree casts long shadows in the dimming light.  The acorns nestled among the tree's massive branches and vividly healthy leaves are new and green.  Near the tree is a quaint looking well of crumbling stone.

A rusty tin pail rests in the grass near the ball machine.

The tennis ball launching machine sitting in one corner of the yard looks like a relic from the 1930s.",point machine at tree,0,You do your best to push the large machine about until it appears to be oriented correctly.,False,train/training_data_acorncourt.z5_p_rand_0.5.csv

Court Yard
A good sized courtyard with an air of late British colonialism about it.  To the west, in the direction the sun is setting, is a high, grey stone wall with an ornate iron gate set into the rock.  The walls of a large stone mansion rise several stories into the chilly evening air to the east, north, and south.  In the east wall, two or three stories up, is a large window.  On top of the west wall, above and to the right of the gate, is a large squirrels nest made of sticks, twigs, and leaves.

A carpeting of old brown leaves from past winters rustle about on the ground in the breeze and drift listlessly across a cracked, stained, pale green tennis court with a rotting net.  In one corner of the court yard an impressively large oak tree casts long shadows in the dimming light.  The acorns nestled among the tree's massive branches and vividly healthy leaves are new and green.  Near the tree is a quaint looking well of crumbling stone.

A rusty tin pail rests in the grass near the ball machine.

Court Yard
A good sized courtyard with an air of late British colonialism about it.  To the west, in the direction the sun is setting, is a high, grey stone wall with an ornate iron gate set into the rock.  The walls of a large stone mansion rise several stories into the chilly evening air to the east, north, and south.  In the east wall, two or three stories up, is a large window.  On top of the west wall, above and to the right of the gate, is a large squirrels nest made of sticks, twigs, and leaves.

A carpeting of old brown leaves from past winters rustle about on the ground in the breeze and drift listlessly across a cracked, stained, pale green tennis court with a rotting net.  In one corner of the court yard an impressively large oak tree casts long shadows in the dimming light.  The acorns nestled among the tree's massive branches and vividly healthy leaves are new and green.  Near the tree is a quaint looking well of crumbling stone.

The walls of a large stone mansion rise several stories into the chilly evening air to the east, north, and south.  In the east wall, two or three stories up, is a large window.  On top of the west wall, above and to the right of the gate, is a large squirrels nest made of sticks, twigs, and leaves.

A carpeting of old brown leaves from past winters rustle about on the ground in the breeze and drift listlessly across a cracked, stained, pale green tennis court with a rotting net.  In one corner of the court yard an impressively large oak tree casts long shadows in the dimming light.  The acorns nestled among the tree's massive branches and vividly healthy leaves are new and green.  Near the tree is a quaint looking well of crumbling stone.

A rusty tin pail rests in the grass near the ball machine.

The tennis ball launching machine sitting in one corner of the yard looks like a relic from the 1930s.",point machine at tree,0,You do your best to push the large machine about until it appears to be oriented correctly.,False,train/training_data_acorncourt.z5_p_rand_0.5.csv

At Window on Pit
You're at a low window overlooking a huge pit, which extends up out of sight. A floor is indistinctly visible over 50 feet below. Traces of white mist cover the floor of the pit, becoming thicker to the right. Marks in the dust around the window would seem to indicate that someone has been here recently. Directly across the pit from you and 25 feet away there is a similar window looking into a lighted room. A shadowy figure can be seen there peering back at you.

The sepulchral voice intones, ""The cave is now closed."" As the echoes fade, there is a blinding flash of light (and a small puff of orange smoke). . . 

As your eyes refocus, you look around...

NE End of Repository
You are at the northeast end of an immense room, even larger than the giant room. It appears to be a repository for the ""Adventure"" program. Massive torches far overhead bathe the room with smoky yellow light. Scattered about you can be seen a pile of bottles (all of them empty), a nursery of young beanstalks murmuring quietly, a bed of oysters, a bundle of black rods with rusty stars on their ends, and a collection of brass lanterns. Off to one side a great many dwarves are sleeping on the floor, snoring loudly. A sign nearby reads: ""Do not disturb the dwarves!""

An immense mirror is hanging against one wall, and stretches to the other end of the room, where various other sundry objects can be glimpsed dimly in the distance.

You are at the southwest end of the repository. To one side is a pit full of fierce green snakes. On the other side is a row of small wicker cages, each of which contains a little sulking bird. In one corner is a bundle of black rods with rusty marks on their ends. A large number of velvet pillows are scattered about on the floor. A vast mirror stretches off to the northeast. At your feet is a large steel grate, next to which is a sign which reads, ""TREASURE VAULT. Keys in main office.""

An immense mirror is hanging against one wall, and stretches to the other end of the room, where various other sundry objects can be glimpsed dimly in the distance.

A cheerful little bird is sitting here singing.

This has never been your favorite part of the city.  Nor is this neighborhood the safest one.  But as a city sanitarian, you are charged with completing an annual health and safety inspection of every restaurant in your district.

Each day you visit three or four restaurants.  During those visits you take note of potential health code violations in your trusty notepad.  Today's first target:  Nikolai's Bar and Grill.

A hazy sun barely peeks above the three-story tenements.

The east/west sidewalk here is cracked and uneven, pocked by clumps of crabgrass.  A storm gutter is built into the curb, littered with broken bottles.

Dining Room
The restaurant area of Nikolai's is relatively small:  no more than a dozen four top tables, many still littered with yesterday's crumbs.  A larger bar area--the primary source of revenue here--lies to the east.  A rickety staircase leads to small balcony outside Nikolai's office loft.  A wide mirror is mounted on the wall high above, right near his office entrance.

On the south end of the room, a long window provides an unattractive view of the street.  The galley kitchen is north of here.

An aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.

Angela is gaunt and anemic.  She struggles to remain alert.

An obese man (Nikolai, the owner?) watches you from the balcony.

""Who's there?  Tell him we're closed"" Nikolai growls in disgust.

Angela cowers, ""I think he's the man from the health department.""  She looks at you ""We're not open right now.""

Nikolai growls again, ""We were just inspected six months ago.  Tell him to go away.""  Without waiting for an answer from either you or Angela, Nikolai turns back into his office and closes the door.

Angela shrugs helplessly, and begins cleaning the dining room.

Bar
Sunlight from the 19th Street window (south) casts an bright trapezoid across the cork dance floor.  In every other corner, the brick walls of this unpretentious watering hole are marked by shadows.  If you don't mind risking ptomaine poisoning, Nikolai's dining room is to the west.  Otherwise, the unisex lavatory is north through a low ceiling tunnel.

A set of Naugahyde stools are pushed against the linoleum bar.

Behind the bar is a dinky two basin sink with an attached faucet.  In the rinse basin is some ice.

A warped wooden door is set into the cement north wall. The door is sealed tight.

""Of course that's where I mean.  Our regular bread company won't deliver here anymore.  Just go to the food pantry and fill up your car.""

Winding Hall

""You are a sharp fellow.  By now I expect you've figured out the situation on your own and I don't have to belabor my strained relationship with Nikolai.  We are both, to put it crudely, vampires.  When I moved into the neighborhood a few years ago, he still had the power to subordinate me.  But I knew he was being weakened by diabetes and it would not be long before I would inherit his territory.  Nikolai knew this as well.  So to prevent my challenge to his dominance he had me abducted and slaughtered.""

This has never been your favorite part of the city.  Nor is this neighborhood the safest one.  But as a city sanitarian, you are charged with completing an annual health and safety inspection of every restaurant in your district.

Each day you visit three or four restaurants.  During those visits you take note of potential health code violations in your trusty notepad.  Today's first target:  Nikolai's Bar and Grill.

A hazy sun barely peeks above the three-story tenements.

You are standing in front of Nikolai's Bar and Grill on 19th Street.  A green awning shades the smudged window into Nikolai's dining room.  The front entrance is north of you.

The east/west sidewalk here is cracked and uneven, pocked by clumps of crabgrass.  A storm gutter is built into the curb, littered with broken bottles.  Across the street a neon sign flickers erratically.  A few cars are parked nearby (including yours), but otherwise you see no evidence that anyone visits this neighborhood past daybreak.

The restaurant area of Nikolai's is relatively small:  no more than a dozen four top tables, many still littered with yesterday's crumbs.

Methods for warding or killing a vampire are so widely known, they are now almost cliché.  For warding:  either a wreath of garlic or a wooden cross worn around the neck should effectively ward off both the Bratislavan and Transylvanian type vampires.  For killing, only a weapon made of silver has any permanent effect.

Of course one is not likely to find these implements (garlic, crosses, or silver weapons) in the vampire's own abode.  This creates a problem for Bratislavan vampires who desire nothing so much as to kill and dominate their rivals.  They achieve this without the use of silver (which might be turned against them) by dismembering their opponents and scattering the remaining parts as widely as possible.  Yet even this gruesome ritual is impermanent.  The dismembered parts of a vampire retain their own force of will, and strive to reassemble themselves by whatever means available.",put all in pitcher,0,"book: Done.

This has never been your favorite part of the city.  Nor is this neighborhood the safest one.  But as a city sanitarian, you are charged with completing an annual health and safety inspection of every restaurant in your district.

Each day you visit three or four restaurants.  During those visits you take note of potential health code violations in your trusty notepad.  Today's first target:  Nikolai's Bar and Grill.

A hazy sun barely peeks above the three-story tenements.

19th Street
You are standing in front of Nikolai's Bar and Grill on 19th Street.  A green awning shades the smudged window into Nikolai's dining room.  The front entrance is north of you.

The east/west sidewalk here is cracked and uneven, pocked by clumps of crabgrass.  A storm gutter is built into the curb, littered with broken bottles.  Across the street a neon sign flickers erratically.  A few cars are parked nearby (including yours), but otherwise you see no evidence that anyone visits this neighborhood past daybreak.

Dining Room
The restaurant area of Nikolai's is relatively small:  no more than a dozen four top tables, many still littered with yesterday's crumbs.  A larger bar area--the primary source of revenue here--lies to the east.  A rickety staircase leads to small balcony outside Nikolai's office loft.  A wide mirror is mounted on the wall high above, right near his office entrance.

On the south end of the room, a long window provides an unattractive view of the street.  The galley kitchen is north of here.

An aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.

Angela is gaunt and anemic.  She struggles to remain alert.

An obese man (Nikolai, the owner?) watches you from the balcony.

""Who's there?  Tell him we're closed"" Nikolai growls in disgust.

Angela cowers, ""I think he's the man from the health department.""  She looks at you ""We're not open right now.""

Nikolai growls again, ""We were just inspected six months ago.  Tell him to go away.""  Without waiting for an answer from either you or Angela, Nikolai turns back into his office and closes the door.

Angela shrugs helplessly, and begins cleaning the dining room.

Since the last time you were here, Nikolai has managed to transport himself down those treacherous steps to the Dining Room.

She sits across Nikolai's lap, scarcely conscious, with just a trace of blood dribbling from twin teeth marks in her neck.  Nikolai looks up from her neck, with blood stains on his own fat face, ""You're next, Mr. Health Inspector.  I knew you'd cause me trouble when you walked in here.""

Methods for warding or killing a vampire are so widely known, they are now almost cliché.

For killing, only a weapon made of silver has any permanent effect.

Of course one is not likely to find these implements (garlic, crosses, or silver weapons) in the vampire's own abode.  This creates a problem for Bratislavan vampires who desire nothing so much as to kill and dominate their rivals.  They achieve this without the use of silver (which might be turned against them) by dismembering their opponents and scattering the remaining parts as widely as possible.

Dining Room
The restaurant area of Nikolai's is relatively small:  no more than a dozen four top tables, many still littered with yesterday's crumbs.  A larger bar area--the primary source of revenue here--lies to the east.  A rickety staircase leads to small balcony outside Nikolai's office loft.  A wide mirror is mounted on the wall high above, right near his office entrance.

On the south end of the room, a long window provides an unattractive view of the street.  The galley kitchen is north of here.

An aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.

Angela is gaunt and anemic.  She struggles to remain alert.

An obese man (Nikolai, the owner?) watches you from the balcony.

""Who's there?  Tell him we're closed"" Nikolai growls in disgust.

Angela cowers, ""I think he's the man from the health department.""  She looks at you ""We're not open right now.""

Nikolai growls again, ""We were just inspected six months ago.  Tell him to go away.""  Without waiting for an answer from either you or Angela, Nikolai turns back into his office and closes the door.

Angela shrugs helplessly, and begins cleaning the dining room.

Dining Room
An aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.

Since the last time you were here, Nikolai has managed to transport himself down those treacherous steps to the Dining Room.  He sits on one of those tiny dining room chairs, which appears barely capable of supporting his weight.  Angela has returned from her bread run.  She sits across Nikolai's lap, scarcely conscious, with just a trace of blood dribbling from twin teeth marks in her neck.  Nikolai looks up from her neck, with blood stains on his own fat face, ""You're next, Mr. Health Inspector.  I knew you'd cause me trouble when you walked in here.""

Since your last tour through the dining room, Nikolai has locked and barred the front door to prevent your escape.",u,0,"Nikolai pursues you up the stairs, huffing and wheezing from the effort.

Nikolai's Office
Nikolai's office is an ill-maintained balcony sky box above his restaurant.  A window looks out over the restaurant. But as you could see earlier, the dining room side is mirrored such that employees and guests can't see in.  A rickety set of steps leads back to the main floor.  The plaster walls are water stained and cracked.  A single unfrosted bulb hangs from the ceiling by a loose wire.  Mounds of unpaid invoices litter Nikolai's wooden desk.

Methods for warding or killing a vampire are so widely known, they are now almost cliché.  For warding:  either a wreath of garlic or a wooden cross worn around the neck should effectively ward off both the Bratislavan and Transylvanian type vampires.  For killing, only a weapon made of silver has any permanent effect.

Of course one is not likely to find these implements (garlic, crosses, or silver weapons) in the vampire's own abode.  This creates a problem for Bratislavan vampires who desire nothing so much as to kill and dominate their rivals.  They achieve this without the use of silver (which might be turned against them) by dismembering their opponents and scattering the remaining parts as widely as possible.  Yet even this gruesome ritual is impermanent.  The dismembered parts of a vampire retain their own force of will, and strive to reassemble themselves by whatever means available.",read culture,0,"You read: Vampire Culture.

Bratislavan vampires, like their Transylvanian cousins, require nightly aliquots of blood for their continued immortality.

Methods for warding or killing a vampire are so widely known, they are now almost cliché.  For warding:  either a wreath of garlic or a wooden cross worn around the neck should effectively ward off both the Bratislavan and Transylvanian type vampires.  For killing, only a weapon made of silver has any permanent effect.

Of course one is not likely to find these implements (garlic, crosses, or silver weapons) in the vampire's own abode.  This creates a problem for Bratislavan vampires who desire nothing so much as to kill and dominate their rivals.  They achieve this without the use of silver (which might be turned against them) by dismembering their opponents and scattering the remaining parts as widely as possible.  Yet even this gruesome ritual is impermanent.  The dismembered parts of a vampire retain their own force of will, and strive to reassemble themselves by whatever means available.",read culture,0,"You read: Vampire Culture.

This has never been your favorite part of the city.  Nor is this neighborhood the safest one.  But as a city sanitarian, you are charged with completing an annual health and safety inspection of every restaurant in your district.

Each day you visit three or four restaurants.  During those visits you take note of potential health code violations in your trusty notepad.  Today's first target:  Nikolai's Bar and Grill.

A hazy sun barely peeks above the three-story tenements.

Dining Room
The restaurant area of Nikolai's is relatively small:  no more than a dozen four top tables, many still littered with yesterday's crumbs.  A larger bar area--the primary source of revenue here--lies to the east.  A rickety staircase leads to small balcony outside Nikolai's office loft.  A wide mirror is mounted on the wall high above, right near his office entrance.

On the south end of the room, a long window provides an unattractive view of the street.  The galley kitchen is north of here.

An aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.

Angela is gaunt and anemic.  She struggles to remain alert.

An obese man (Nikolai, the owner?) watches you from the balcony.

""Who's there?  Tell him we're closed"" Nikolai growls in disgust.

Angela cowers, ""I think he's the man from the health department.""  She looks at you ""We're not open right now.""

Nikolai growls again, ""We were just inspected six months ago.  Tell him to go away.""  Without waiting for an answer from either you or Angela, Nikolai turns back into his office and closes the door.

Angela shrugs helplessly, and begins cleaning the dining room.

""Of course that's where I mean.  Our regular bread company won't deliver here anymore.  Just go to the food pantry and fill up your car."" 

""I can't take food from a homeless shelter."" 

Nikolai's face turns red, ""We need bread, and you can get it free from the mission.  Tell them you're a homeless wench.  Tell them you've got twelve screaming brats to feed.  I don't care.

This has never been your favorite part of the city.  Nor is this neighborhood the safest one.  But as a city sanitarian, you are charged with completing an annual health and safety inspection of every restaurant in your district.

Each day you visit three or four restaurants.  During those visits you take note of potential health code violations in your trusty notepad.  Today's first target:  Nikolai's Bar and Grill.

She is, at present, unaware that you've entered the room.

This has never been your favorite part of the city.  Nor is this neighborhood the safest one.  But as a city sanitarian, you are charged with completing an annual health and safety inspection of every restaurant in your district.

Each day you visit three or four restaurants.  During those visits you take note of potential health code violations in your trusty notepad.  Today's first target:  Nikolai's Bar and Grill.

A hazy sun barely peeks above the three-story tenements.

You are standing in front of Nikolai's Bar and Grill on 19th Street.  A green awning shades the smudged window into Nikolai's dining room.  The front entrance is north of you.

The east/west sidewalk here is cracked and uneven, pocked by clumps of crabgrass.  A storm gutter is built into the curb, littered with broken bottles.  Across the street a neon sign flickers erratically.  A few cars are parked nearby (including yours), but otherwise you see no evidence that anyone visits this neighborhood past daybreak.

Dining Room
The restaurant area of Nikolai's is relatively small:  no more than a dozen four top tables, many still littered with yesterday's crumbs.  A larger bar area--the primary source of revenue here--lies to the east.  A rickety staircase leads to small balcony outside Nikolai's office loft.  A wide mirror is mounted on the wall high above, right near his office entrance.

On the south end of the room, a long window provides an unattractive view of the street.  The galley kitchen is north of here.

Angela cowers, ""I think he's the man from the health department.""  She looks at you ""We're not open right now.""

Methods for warding or killing a vampire are so widely known, they are now almost cliché.  For warding:  either a wreath of garlic or a wooden cross worn around the neck should effectively ward off both the Bratislavan and Transylvanian type vampires.  For killing, only a weapon made of silver has any permanent effect.

Of course one is not likely to find these implements (garlic, crosses, or silver weapons) in the vampire's own abode.  This creates a problem for Bratislavan vampires who desire nothing so much as to kill and dominate their rivals.  They achieve this without the use of silver (which might be turned against them) by dismembering their opponents and scattering the remaining parts as widely as possible.  Yet even this gruesome ritual is impermanent.  The dismembered parts of a vampire retain their own force of will, and strive to reassemble themselves by whatever means available.",put tongs in kit,0,You put the pair of tongs into the first aid kit.,False,train/training_data_afflicted.z8_p_rand_0.5.csv

Bratislavan vampires, like their Transylvanian cousins, require nightly aliquots of blood for their continued immortality.

The most dominant vampire in a given territory is the arch-vampire.",d,0,"

You are standing in front of Nikolai's Bar and Grill on 19th Street.  A green awning shades the smudged window into Nikolai's dining room.  The front entrance is north of you.

The east/west sidewalk here is cracked and uneven, pocked by clumps of crabgrass.  A storm gutter is built into the curb, littered with broken bottles.  Across the street a neon sign flickers erratically.  A few cars are parked nearby (including yours), but otherwise you see no evidence that anyone visits this neighborhood past daybreak.

Dining Room
The restaurant area of Nikolai's is relatively small:  no more than a dozen four top tables, many still littered with yesterday's crumbs.  A larger bar area--the primary source of revenue here--lies to the east.  A rickety staircase leads to small balcony outside Nikolai's office loft.  A wide mirror is mounted on the wall high above, right near his office entrance.

On the south end of the room, a long window provides an unattractive view of the street.  The galley kitchen is north of here.

An aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.

Angela is gaunt and anemic.  She struggles to remain alert.

An obese man (Nikolai, the owner?) watches you from the balcony.

""Who's there?  Tell him we're closed"" Nikolai growls in disgust.

Angela cowers, ""I think he's the man from the health department.""  She looks at you ""We're not open right now.""

Nikolai growls again, ""We were just inspected six months ago.  Tell him to go away.""  Without waiting for an answer from either you or Angela, Nikolai turns back into his office and closes the door.

Angela shrugs helplessly, and begins cleaning the dining room.

Bar
Sunlight from the 19th Street window (south) casts an bright trapezoid across the cork dance floor.  In every other corner, the brick walls of this unpretentious watering hole are marked by shadows.  If you don't mind risking ptomaine poisoning, Nikolai's dining room is to the west.  Otherwise, the unisex lavatory is north through a low ceiling tunnel.

""Of course that's where I mean.  Our regular bread company won't deliver here anymore.  Just go to the food pantry and fill up your car."" 

""I can't take food from a homeless shelter."" 

Nikolai's face turns red, ""We need bread, and you can get it free from the mission.  Tell them you're a homeless wench.  Tell them you've got twelve screaming brats to feed.  I don't care.  If you won't go there, then go to the store and pay for the bread with your own money, but don't come back without it!""

Nikolai's Office
Nikolai's office is an ill-maintained balcony sky box above his restaurant.  A window looks out over the restaurant. But as you could see earlier, the dining room side is mirrored such that employees and guests can't see in.  A rickety set of steps leads back to the main floor.  The plaster walls are water stained and cracked.  A single unfrosted bulb hangs from the ceiling by a loose wire.  Mounds of unpaid invoices litter Nikolai's wooden desk.

Methods for warding or killing a vampire are so widely known, they are now almost cliché.  For warding:  either a wreath of garlic or a wooden cross worn around the neck should effectively ward off both the Bratislavan and Transylvanian type vampires.  For killing, only a weapon made of silver has any permanent effect.

Of course one is not likely to find these implements (garlic, crosses, or silver weapons) in the vampire's own abode.  This creates a problem for Bratislavan vampires who desire nothing so much as to kill and dominate their rivals.  They achieve this without the use of silver (which might be turned against them) by dismembering their opponents and scattering the remaining parts as widely as possible.  Yet even this gruesome ritual is impermanent.  The dismembered parts of a vampire retain their own force of will, and strive to reassemble themselves by whatever means available.",read culture,0,"You read: Vampire Culture.

Methods for warding or killing a vampire are so widely known, they are now almost cliché.  For warding:  either a wreath of garlic or a wooden cross worn around the neck should effectively ward off both the Bratislavan and Transylvanian type vampires.  For killing, only a weapon made of silver has any permanent effect.

Of course one is not likely to find these implements (garlic, crosses, or silver weapons) in the vampire's own abode.  This creates a problem for Bratislavan vampires who desire nothing so much as to kill and dominate their rivals.  They achieve this without the use of silver (which might be turned against them) by dismembering their opponents and scattering the remaining parts as widely as possible.  Yet even this gruesome ritual is impermanent.  The dismembered parts of a vampire retain their own force of will, and strive to reassemble themselves by whatever means available.",examine room,0,"About twelve tables are closely spaced within the small location.

You remember darkness. And the cold. Cold and darkness. And silence. Those memories are all that you have. That, and a feeling that something you never knew you possessed has been lost.

Suddenly, oblivion is split by a blinding light and a crash of sound. You awaken to the roar of a storm and a deluge of rain and mud.

Graveyard
Dozens of stone markers stand here, oblivious to the wind and the rain. Huge, twisted oaks, their limbs tossed by the wind, draw an unmentionable sustenance from the moss-covered, moldy ground. An odor of decay, which even the storm cannot dissipate, hangs over everything. An iron barred fence surrounds the graveyard, an ivy-covered barrier separating it from the world of the living. The only exit is through the gate to the east.

A church rises to the east, its boarded up windows giving the impression that it is covering its eyes from the sight of the graveyard.

Front of the Church
Two massive oak trees which flank the cracked sidewalk dominate the front of the church. The facade of the church itself rises beyond them, its steeple silhouetted against the sky. The storm lashes at its faded white facade, almost as if the storm is trying to wash the church clean; something you somehow realize will take more than mere water to accomplish.

Now, it is a withered mass of decaying flesh. It's clothing hangs in tatters and it is caked in mud and grave mold. Patches of hair hang from it's scalp and bones are visible in places through it's skin. The only thing that remains intact are it's eyes; pale blue and now wide open and staring.

The creature raises its hand to you, and you find yourself doing the same. You reach out your arm and touch...

Then, the mist starts moving slowly downward as he doubles over and screams in agony. As the mist soaks into the ground, he looks up at you and screams, ""I'll get my revenge""  I'll see you in hell.  I'LL SEE YOU IN HELL! Ia! Ia! Fthagn...  Aaaaagh...!""

His body collapses to the ground.  As you watch the body blackens and decays until, within only a few moments, what is left appears to be a many-months old corpse.

You hear a sudden *Whumph!* and look around. The spilled oil from the broken lantern has ignited.  You grab the blue bottle from the table and race outside.  You watch for a moment as flames consume the church. With a crackling roar, the steeple collapses inward and a plume of flame shoots skyward.

Clutching the bottle to you, you make your way down the hill.

You remember darkness. And the cold. Cold and darkness. And silence. Those memories are all that you have. That, and a feeling that something you never knew you possessed has been lost.

Suddenly, oblivion is split by a blinding light and a crash of sound. You awaken to the roar of a storm and a deluge of rain and mud.

Graveyard
Dozens of stone markers stand here, oblivious to the wind and the rain. Huge, twisted oaks, their limbs tossed by the wind, draw an unmentionable sustenance from the moss-covered, moldy ground. An odor of decay, which even the storm cannot dissipate, hangs over everything. An iron barred fence surrounds the graveyard, an ivy-covered barrier separating it from the world of the living. The only exit is through the gate to the east.

A church rises to the east, its boarded up windows giving the impression that it is covering its eyes from the sight of the graveyard.

Graveyard
Dozens of stone markers stand here, oblivious to the wind and the rain. Huge, twisted oaks, their limbs tossed by the wind, draw an unmentionable sustenance from the moss-covered, moldy ground. An odor of decay, which even the storm cannot dissipate, hangs over everything. An iron barred fence surrounds the graveyard, an ivy-covered barrier separating it from the world of the living.

Steeple Chamber
This small chamber is about halfway up the steeple of the church. Rain and wind from the storm outside blows in through an open window frame and water collects in puddles on the warped floor, mixing with the droppings of the birds, or perhaps bats, which can be heard fluttering around overhead. Looking up, you can see a maze of beams and supports that form the interior of the steeple. Rain pours in from an opening higher in the steeple and trickles out through a trap door in the floor.

A frayed but heavy rope hangs from somewhere overhead.

Dozens of stone markers stand here, oblivious to the wind and the rain. Huge, twisted oaks, their limbs tossed by the wind, draw an unmentionable sustenance from the moss-covered, moldy ground.

Graveyard
Dozens of stone markers stand here, oblivious to the wind and the rain. Huge, twisted oaks, their limbs tossed by the wind, draw an unmentionable sustenance from the moss-covered, moldy ground. An odor of decay, which even the storm cannot dissipate, hangs over everything. An iron barred fence surrounds the graveyard, an ivy-covered barrier separating it from the world of the living. The only exit is through the gate to the east.

Now, it is a withered mass of decaying flesh. It's clothing hangs in tatters and it is caked in mud and grave mold. Patches of hair hang from it's scalp and bones are visible in places through it's skin. The only thing that remains intact are it's eyes; pale blue and now wide open and staring.

The creature raises its hand to you, and you find yourself doing the same. You reach out your arm and touch...

Then, the mist starts moving slowly downward as he doubles over and screams in agony. As the mist soaks into the ground, he looks up at you and screams, ""I'll get my revenge""  I'll see you in hell.  I'LL SEE YOU IN HELL! Ia! Ia! Fthagn...  Aaaaagh...!""

His body collapses to the ground.  As you watch the body blackens and decays until, within only a few moments, what is left appears to be a many-months old corpse.

You hear a sudden *Whumph!* and look around. The spilled oil from the broken lantern has ignited.  You grab the blue bottle from the table and race outside.  You watch for a moment as flames consume the church. With a crackling roar, the steeple collapses inward and a plume of flame shoots skyward.

Clutching the bottle to you, you make your way down the hill.

You remember darkness. And the cold. Cold and darkness. And silence. Those memories are all that you have. That, and a feeling that something you never knew you possessed has been lost.

Suddenly, oblivion is split by a blinding light and a crash of sound. You awaken to the roar of a storm and a deluge of rain and mud.

Graveyard
Dozens of stone markers stand here, oblivious to the wind and the rain. Huge, twisted oaks, their limbs tossed by the wind, draw an unmentionable sustenance from the moss-covered, moldy ground. An odor of decay, which even the storm cannot dissipate, hangs over everything. An iron barred fence surrounds the graveyard, an ivy-covered barrier separating it from the world of the living. The only exit is through the gate to the east.

A church rises to the east, its boarded up windows giving the impression that it is covering its eyes from the sight of the graveyard.

Front of the Church
Two massive oak trees which flank the cracked sidewalk dominate the front of the church. The facade of the church itself rises beyond them, its steeple silhouetted against the sky. The storm lashes at its faded white facade, almost as if the storm is trying to wash the church clean; something you somehow realize will take more than mere water to accomplish. To the north, a sidewalk leads to the front of the church. A weed-choked driveway runs to the northeast and down a hill to the south, and a muddy path leads around the church to the northwest.

The church and steeple loom to the north, the open window frames seeming to stare with judgment upon anyone standing before it.

Now, it is a withered mass of decaying flesh. It's clothing hangs in tatters and it is caked in mud and grave mold. Patches of hair hang from it's scalp and bones are visible in places through it's skin. The only thing that remains intact are it's eyes; pale blue and now wide open and staring.

The creature raises its hand to you, and you find yourself doing the same. You reach out your arm and touch...

Then, the mist starts moving slowly downward as he doubles over and screams in agony. As the mist soaks into the ground, he looks up at you and screams, ""I'll get my revenge""  I'll see you in hell.  I'LL SEE YOU IN HELL! Ia! Ia! Fthagn...  Aaaaagh...!""

His body collapses to the ground.  As you watch the body blackens and decays until, within only a few moments, what is left appears to be a many-months old corpse.

You hear a sudden *Whumph!* and look around. The spilled oil from the broken lantern has ignited.  You grab the blue bottle from the table and race outside.  You watch for a moment as flames consume the church. With a crackling roar, the steeple collapses inward and a plume of flame shoots skyward.

Clutching the bottle to you, you make your way down the hill.

You remember darkness. And the cold. Cold and darkness. And silence. Those memories are all that you have. That, and a feeling that something you never knew you possessed has been lost.

Suddenly, oblivion is split by a blinding light and a crash of sound. You awaken to the roar of a storm and a deluge of rain and mud.

"As you scramble out of the hole the mud collapses downward, filling in the hole behind you.

Graveyard
Dozens of stone markers stand here, oblivious to the wind and the rain. Huge, twisted oaks, their limbs tossed by the wind, draw an unmentionable sustenance from the moss-covered, moldy ground. An odor of decay, which even the storm cannot dissipate, hangs over everything. An iron barred fence surrounds the graveyard, an ivy-covered barrier separating it from the world of the living. The only exit is through the gate to the east.

A church rises to the east, its boarded up windows giving the impression that it is covering its eyes from the sight of the graveyard.

Front of the Church
Two massive oak trees which flank the cracked sidewalk dominate the front of the church. The facade of the church itself rises beyond them, its steeple silhouetted against the sky. The storm lashes at its faded white facade, almost as if the storm is trying to wash the church clean; something you somehow realize will take more than mere water to accomplish. To the north, a sidewalk leads to the front of the church. A weed-choked driveway runs to the northeast and down a hill to the south, and a muddy path leads around the church to the northwest.

The church and steeple loom to the north, the open window frames seeming to stare with judgment upon anyone standing before it.

Steeple Chamber
This small chamber is about halfway up the steeple of the church. Rain and wind from the storm outside blows in through an open window frame and water collects in puddles on the warped floor, mixing with the droppings of the birds, or perhaps bats, which can be heard fluttering around overhead. Looking up, you can see a maze of beams and supports that form the interior of the steeple. Rain pours in from an opening higher in the steeple and trickles out through a trap door in the floor.
